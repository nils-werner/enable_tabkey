Enable Tabkey
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Nils Werner (nils.werner@gmail.com)
Build Date: 2009-05-26
Requirements: Symphony 2.02


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'enable_tabkey' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Enable Tabkey" entry, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now use the Tabkey in your code editors.

[NOTES]

- Currently incompatible with the "markItUp!"-extension, hopefully that will be resolved in Symphony 2.0.3 and its unified JS-libraries.
  If its my fault and I'm also breaking other extensions, please let me know!
